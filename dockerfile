I apologize for the confusion. The issue seems to be related to the fact that the `CMD` instruction in a Dockerfile should not include flags. Instead, you should use the `CMD` instruction to set the default command and then use the `ENTRYPOINT` instruction to add flags.

Here's an updated Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM portainer/portainer-ce:latest

# Expose the Portainer port
EXPOSE 9000

# Set up persistent storage for the Docker socket
VOLUME /var/run/docker.sock

# Set the default command for Portainer
CMD ["--data", "/data"]

# Define entry point with flags
ENTRYPOINT ["--host", "0.0.0.0", "--no-auth"]
```

In this example, I've used `CMD` to set the default data directory, and `ENTRYPOINT` to specify additional flags such as the host and disabling authentication. Adjust the flags according to your Portainer configuration.

Build and run the image locally:

```bash
docker build -t my-portainer-image .
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 my-portainer-image
```

Remember to adapt this Dockerfile according to your specific Portainer configuration and requirements.
